# devbootcamp

A restful API that allows publishers to add bootcamps and their corresponding courses for each bootcamp.
This is reflected on the front end with users able to search bootcamps and filtering them according to budget and highest rated.
My last project used redux thunk for async calls for state management, this project I will take on REDUX SAGA.

Testing will be done using JEST and ENZYME. This is something I will need to learn.
